# Sokoban Game

## Overview

This Python project implements a classic puzzle game called **Sokoban**. In this game, players control a character who pushes crates into designated storage spots within a confined space, navigating through obstacles and strategic challenges.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Move the player character to push crates into target holes.
- **Undo & Restart**: Press "u" to undo previous moves or "r" to restart the game at any time.
- **Step Counter**: Track your progress by counting how many moves you've made.
- **Command-line Interface**: Simple and intuitive text-based interaction.

## Project Structure

- `sokoban_game.py`: The main Python script containing the game logic and interaction.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python sokoban_game.py
   ```
